Consequently, financiers could be hindered from developing a full understanding of the underwritten risks and are thus unable or only partially able to evaluate their full potential to expand financial relationships over the credit capability of a single counterparty with respect to the supplier\u2013debtor pair. The richness of the information available in trade credit financing is not an obstacle for the development of a modern risk management framework, but it must be calibrated to avoid distortions in the implementation.
