As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity over the long run, but the immediate consequences of mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic inequality skyrocketed. "

Taking his typically in-depth, historically informed view, Thom Hartmann examines the brutal role guns have played in American history, from the genocide of the Native Americans to the enforcement of slavery (Slave Patrols are in fact the Second Amendment's “well-regulated militias”) and the racist post–Civil War social order. He shows how the NRA and conservative Supreme Court justices used specious logic to invent a virtually unlimited individual right to own guns, which has enabled the ever-growing number of mass shootings in the United States.

From happy hour, to entrée, to dessert, use any brand of electric smoker to wow your family and neighbors without building a smokehouse in your backyard. "

Because relationships are absolutely crucial, Kuhl describes how to build support networks before you even need them and explains how to get actionable feedback that will help you get to the next level—the kind women rarely are afforded.

LEDs are great for visualizing data so you will be able to see some of the more complicated concepts, such as pulse width modulation (PWM) and analog control, in real time on the breadboard. In this video, you will cover LED control with Arduino, beginning with some simple LED blinking (the “hello world” for electronics) and then build step-by-step by adding extra hardware to interface with the code and circuits (buttons, potentiometers, and so on).

Using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in big data environments can identify historical patterns and build artificial intelligence (AI) models that can help businesses to improve customer experience, add services and offerings, identify new revenue streams or lines of business (LOBs), and optimize business or manufacturing operations. The power of AI for predictive analytics is being harnessed across all industries, so it is important that businesses familiarize themselves with all of the tools and techniques that are available for integration with their data lake environments.

In the management context leadership has been consistently identified as playing a critical role in the success or failure of organizations and some surveys have pegged almost half of an organization’s performance on the quality and effectiveness of its leadership team. Apart from organizational performance, researchers have consistently found a strong correlation between leadership styles and behaviors and the job satisfaction and performance of subordinates. "

Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 7.0.x releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content. We updated all of the course’s code-along video content to fix the breaking changes, including: Angular-CLI &amp; npm syntax usage Angular-CLI template output changes Material 2 inclusion and configuration syntax changes Fallout of the above deltas outdated a large percentage of the course’s existing content.
